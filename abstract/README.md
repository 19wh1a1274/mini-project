In India a countless number of children are reported missing every year. Among the missing
child cases a large percentage of children remain untraced because the child missing from one
region may be found in another region or another state, for various reasons. Our project makes
use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing child from the photos of
children available in the portal, with the help of face recognition. The public can upload
photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with landmarks and remarks. The photo
will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing child from the
repository. Classification of the input child image is performed and photo with best match will be
selected from the database of missing children. The image taken by public may not be of good
quality and some other challenges. For this, a deep learning model is trained to correctly identify
the missing child from the database provided, using the facial image uploaded by the public and
will overcome all the challenges. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective
deep learning technique for image-based applications is used here for face recognition. Face
descriptors are extracted from the images using a pre-trained CNN model VGG-Face deep
architecture. Compared with normal deep learning applications, our algorithm uses convolution
network only as a high-level feature extractor and the child is recognized by the trained SVM
classifier.
