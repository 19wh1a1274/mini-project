Among the missing child cases a large percentage of children remain untraced. So our
project make use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing child
from the photos of multitude of children available, with the help of face recognition. So
that the public can upload photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with
landmarks and remarks. The photo will be automatically compared with the registered
photos of the missing child from the repository.
